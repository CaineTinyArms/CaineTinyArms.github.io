      <h2>Dall of Cuty Ramblings</h2>
      <p>
        So, the entire idea of creating Dall of Cuty was an excuse for me to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 for <b><i>inspiration</i></b>. Little did I know the project would take over my life and leave me with no time to play the new zombie maps. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Dall of Cuty was the second game I made for the second year of my university course, and was the first solo game I created for the university course (not first solo game ever, just for the course). With development starting just a week after finishing <a href="https://burnttoastdev.itch.io/contained-cargo"> Contained Cargo</a>
        in the Godot Engine, I decided to go back to my old trusted Unreal Engine, as I knew with the short timeframe I set myself of 5 weeks, I would need to use something familiar in order to implement everything I wanted to. <br>
        I learned <b>A LOT</b> from this project - from AI and state machines, to custom animations and blendspaces, to very rudimental 3D modelling in Blender, and while the project was very intense and the crunch was insane, it was a lot of fun to work on and learn all the new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the technical skills I learnt from developing Dall of Cuty, it also helped me refine my general game development process, with weekly deadlines and builds, great documentation and very, very, intense testing. But now that all the positive things are out of the way now, let's move onto some of the lessons 
        I have learnt from the development of Dall of Cuty. The biggest lesson I would say I've learnt is - if you're ahead of the deadlines, don't add extra features and deadlines just because "you have extra time". Leave it until the end of the project, if you have extra time at the end, knock yourself out, go wild.
        Don't say "Oh I finished the gun system 3 days into the 1 week deadline I set myself, that gives me 4 days to add a Pack-A-Punch machine with three tier upgrades for all 12 guns in the game." <br>
        Another big lesson I would say I've learnt is - don't use the most recent version of a game engine, unless you have a good reason to use it. When starting development I decided to use the most recent version of Unreal Engine at the time, which was 5.3. After a week of hard work, a lot of crashes, and general disagreements with the engine,
        I changed to 5.1. However, that meant I lost all the progress I made on the 5.3 version of the game, as the projects are not backwards compatible. While I'm not the biggest fan of 5.1 either, it didn't crash for me so it was a needed change. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The final thoughts I have on my time developing Dall of Cuty is that this project made me realise the joys of working in a team, as I missed being able to bounce ideas off people, and just have a general goof around while making the game.<br> <br>
        So yeah, that's Dall of Cuty. Started out as an excuse, ended as a big lesson. <sub>please dont sue me bill gates</sub>
