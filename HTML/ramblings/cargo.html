      <h2>Contained Cargo Ramblings</h2>
      <p>
        Contained Cargo. What to say about Contained Cargo. New engine, familiar face. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on Cargo, that's what I'll be calling it because the name is long, once again with Kieron. Kieron is a big advocate for Godot Engine,
        so we decided to use it, instead of my prefered Unreal Engine, which was a big change of pace for me. Due to my unfamiliarity with the Godot Engine, Kieron was kind enough to let me do the programming side of the game, while he dealt with the art direction, level design that side of the game.
        So I Programmed the interaction system, the random sedative require system, those things.<br>
        Working on this project was a blast though. Working with my good friend Kieron once again was a lot of fun, making a game heavily inspired by one of my favourite Game Devs '<a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/"> Mike Klubnika</a>', what more could I ask for.
        Bouncing ideas off Kieron, expanding our one sentence pitch, to a multi-level, multi-feature game, in the short time frame of 4 weeks, was a joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did learn some lessons from this game though - namely, communicate better when not in person. Reply to messages in a timely response, inform the team what is being worked on, what has been done etc.<br>
        But other than that, Cargo is one of my favourite games to make, maybe 2nd, behind bergs. And I'd love to go back to it in the future one day. Maybe a VR version?
