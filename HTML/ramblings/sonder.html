      <p>
        I had the idea for Sonder floating around for a while. I had a vivid idea of what I wanted the game to be, and was just looking for the right time to make the game. 
        I thought this would be the right time... paired up with two excellent developers Stevie and Sebastian, I thought this would be the perfect time to create the game I had wanted to make for so long.
        However, plans changed. The team expanded, motivation was lost and the vivid vision of the game I had once oh so desired to make, was merely a memory.

        Okay, so that first paragraph sounded really dramatic and made it sound like I absolutely hate this game. I just want to make it clear... I like the game. The technical aspects of the game are great with the repeating city and the 
        dialog system, it works well. I was in charge of the Menus for the game, and I did my job sufficiently, custom assets, animations etc, it suits the theme we ended up going for in the game. This is also the first game I properly used 
        the GitHub pull requests system in, so that's a positive. Overall development of the game was an enjoyable experience, spending days in voice calls with the other team members, helping each other solve problems, brainstorm ideas, and just joking around
        was a fun experience, it also helped me learn new aspects of the Godot Engine, which keeps growing on me every time I use it. 
      </p>

        So what's the future plans for Sonder? One day, after enough time has passed, I'll go back and create the Sonder game I had envisioned many years ago. I want to take my time creating it, as the game idea means a lot to me. So keep an eye out in the future 
        for Sonder: Reflections - The Caine Cut. (not really it'll just be called Sonder).
