      <h2>Shrink Ramblings</h2>
      <p>
        Shrink was developed as the first game for my university course, and was also my first forte into game development. I was lucky to be in a team with two great developers,
        Kieron and Ben. While we were all lacking the experience (well, experience in Unreal for Kieron), we all dived right in and created a game that I would say, still holds up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shrink taught me ALOT about the process of creating a game. It helped refine my GitHub abilities, it taught me how to work in a team (and how not to work in a team).
        If I was to go back, get the band back together, and continue making Shrink, I think I'd suggest just scrapping everything and starting from scratch. But, Shrink, in it's current state, holds some fond memories.
        I don't really have much else to say about Shrink. While not my favourite game I've ever made, it's certainly not my worst, and I can live with that. A good first attempt, but room for improvement.
