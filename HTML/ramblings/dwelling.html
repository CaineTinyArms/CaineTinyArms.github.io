      <h2>The Dwelling Afar Ramblings</h2>
      <p>
        The Dwelling Afar, my beloved. This game holds a special place in my heart, and was developed as the second game for my university course.
        Okay I won't lie, the game is rough around the corners. There's bugs, janky gameplay and visual errors. But there's also a charm about the game 
        I just really resonate with. The game is almost comforting to think about, even if development was the furthest thing away from comforting.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Unreal Engine skills improved ten-fold while developing The Dwelling Afar. I was on a team once again, this time a larger team that consisted of 3 other talented developers - William, Finley and Stevie.
        Roles were distributed and I was the lead developer once again, and there was many challenges faced. Where to start....
        I had never made an inventory system before, and the one I created for the game was, jank. That's the best way to word it. It is the first thing I would change 
        if I was to go and continute development on The Dwelling Afar. The interaction system is also the first one I ever made, and I would also change that. But all that's hindsight stuff.
        The skill I improved the most while working on this game was my Teamwork and Communication (beside my Unreal skills ofc). It was good to bounce ideas back and forth with people, think about what would work, what 
        wouldn't work etc. This was the first project I used Slack for, and I'd say it was used sufficiently, along with my GitHub use. Issues were created more frequently, 
        builds were often, and documentation was much more abundant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as I love The Dwelling Afar, I don't think I'd ever go back and remake, create a sequel or anything of the sort. It was a one and done in my eyes,
        and I still use most of the stuff I learnt from this game in the newer games I make. So yeah, I love the game a lot, but I also hate the game a lot.
