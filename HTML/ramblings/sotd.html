      <h2>Supermarket of the Dead Ramblings</h2>
      <p>
        The whole idea of Supermarket of the Dead (SotD for future use) came from a conversation between a work colleague and myself, where we jokingly said that the company would make us work even during a zombie apocalypse, and that they would make us pay for our own defenses...
        well, five pints later and a lot of tinkering, SotD was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project I do, I try to do something new so I can learn and expand my skills. However, with how basic the game concept is, there was nothing new to learn. Until I made the decision that SotD would be the game where I learn about saving and loading persistant data.
        First things first, the saving and loading works. For the majority of the time. I would say it's a fun little idea, it reminds me of an old flash game I would play in the computer lab in school, which is where my first improvement would come from. This game taught me 
        that some games are more suited towards other game engines. SotD was developed in Unreal Engine... which is not what you think of when you read the line "an old flash game". So in hindsight, I would of made this game in Godot Engine, which has the capability of creating a web build
        more easier than in Unreal.

        There's nothing really else to say about SotD. It's a small fun side project that was born from a joke. Looking back on the game though, I think of it as a early incarnation of my Dall of Cuty game, just not as advanced, less features and more arcadey. But hey, at least that shows range?<br>
        So yeah... I set out to make a game with a saving and loading feature, and I made a game with a saving and loading feature. Enough said.
